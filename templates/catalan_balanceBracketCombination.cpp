Application in some combinatorial problems
The Catalan number Cn is the solution for
* Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of n opening and n closing brackets.
* The number of rooted full binary trees with n + 1 leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.
* The number of ways to completely parenthesize n + 1 factors.
* The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with n + 2 sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).
* The number of ways to connect the 2n points on a circle to form n disjoint chords.
* The number of non-isomorphic full binary trees with n internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).
* The number of monotonic lattice paths from point (0, 0) to point (n, n) in a square lattice of size n X n, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting (0, 0) to (n, n)).
* Number of permutations of length n that can be stack sorted (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index i < j < k, such that ak < a; < a;).
* The number of non-crossing partitions of a set of n elements.
* The number of ways to cover the ladder 1... n using n rectangles (The ladder consists of n columns, where ith column has a height i).

example:
Your task is to calculate the number of valid bracket sequences of length n. For example, when n=6, there are 5 sequences:
()()()
()(())
(())()
((()))
(()())
